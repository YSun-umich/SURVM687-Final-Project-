# SURVM687-Final-Project
This is the final paper I am writing for the Multilevel Modeling Class of this fall term. The research question is to investigate the longitudinal trajectories of self-perceived memory in adults aged 50 and older and to determine whether the number of years of formal education moderates the rate of change in these subjective memory assessments over time. This work aims to clarify the relationship between education and cognitive aging by shifting the focus from objective cognitive test performance to individuals' own perceptions of their memory, using longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study (2000-2020) to model these trajectories while controlling for key demographic and methodological variables.
